# Python-KeyLogger
A Simple KeyLogger I made using Python.

What is a KeyLogger?<br>
          - A keylogger, sometimes called a keystroke logger or keyboard capture, is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke on a specific computer. Keylogger software is also available for use on smartphones, such as the Apple iPhone and Android devices.<br>
<br>
I made this Python KeyLogger using the library <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pynput/"> Pynput </a>
<br>
<ins><h2>Pynput</h2></ins> 
This library allows you to control and monitor input devices.Currently, mouse and keyboard input and monitoring are supported.<br>Click <a href="https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a> for complete documentation on the package.
<br>

<h2>How this works?</h2><br>
•Download the files as zip file or clone the repository using Github Desktop.<br>
•Before download you may or may not need to turn off your Anti-Virus software as this is a Key=Logger windows or other Anti-Virus may delete this file during the download.<br>
•Download the package <ins>pynput</ins> with the help of cmd using the command "<ins>pip install pynput</ins>"⠀<br>
•Open the file and run it.<br>
•Boom there you go your Key-Logger has started working and the keystrokes will be saved to the log.txt file which is provided in the folder.
